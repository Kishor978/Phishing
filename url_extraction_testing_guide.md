# URL Extraction Testing Guide

I've fixed the URL extraction logic to handle various URL formats found in phishing emails, including URLs enclosed in square brackets. Here's how to test the improved functionality:

## 1. Test the URL Extraction Logic Directly

Run the test script to verify that the URL extraction logic works with various URL formats:

```bash
# Activate your virtual environment
source venv/Scripts/activate  # On Windows
# or
source venv/bin/activate     # On Linux/Mac

# Run the test script
python test_url_extraction.py
```

This will run a series of tests against the extraction logic and show you which tests pass or fail.

## 2. Test with the Phishing Email Examples

1. Run your Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run src/app.py
   ```

2. Copy the subject and body from any of the examples in `test_phishing_examples.md`

3. Paste them into the app's input fields and click "Analyze Email"

4. Verify that:
   - URLs are correctly extracted from the email body
   - The extracted URLs are properly displayed in the UI
   - Each URL is analyzed by your URL phishing detection model
   - The sentiment analysis correctly identifies emotional triggers

## 3. Understanding the Changes

The URL extraction logic has been improved in several ways:

1. Now supports three types of URL patterns:
   - Standard URLs with http(s) protocol
   - URLs without protocol (e.g., example.com/path)
   - URLs enclosed in brackets (e.g., [example.com/path])

2. Automatically adds "http://" to URLs without a protocol for analysis

3. Improves URL display in the UI with a more organized table format

4. Better handling of URLs with special characters and query parameters

## 4. Expected Results

When testing with the provided phishing examples, you should see:

- Example 1: Should extract and analyze "secure-verification-link.com/verify?id=12345"
- Example 2: Should extract and analyze "claim-your-prize-now.com/winner/12345"
- Example 3: Should extract and analyze "company-email-system.com/reset"
- Example 4: Should extract and analyze "customer-order-verification.com/order/78954"
- Example 5: Should extract and analyze "legitcompany.com/help" and "legitcompany.com/unsubscribe"

The sentiment analysis should also correctly identify emotional triggers like urgency, fear, and reward tactics used in these examples.
