# Sentiment Analysis Implementation Guide

This guide explains how to set up and use the new sentiment analysis component added to your phishing detection system.

## Installation

1. **Install the new dependency**:
   ```bash
   pip install nltk==3.8.1
   ```

2. **Download NLTK resources**:
   The `PhishingSentimentAnalyzer` class will automatically download the VADER lexicon the first time it's used, but you can also manually download it:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
   ```

## How It Works

The sentiment analysis component works as a separate analysis pipeline alongside your existing phishing detection models:

1. Your main dual encoder transformer model continues to classify emails based on learned patterns
2. The sentiment analyzer examines emotional manipulation tactics often used in phishing:
   - Urgency language
   - Fear-inducing content
   - Promises of rewards
   - False trust building

## Features

- **Emotion Detection**: Identifies specific emotional triggers used in phishing
- **Explainable Results**: Provides human-readable explanations of detected tactics
- **Standalone Analysis**: Can be used separately or in conjunction with your main model

## Integration with the App

The sentiment analysis has been integrated into the Streamlit app and will:

1. Run automatically when an email is analyzed
2. Display results in an expandable section called "Email Sentiment Analysis"
3. Show both quantitative scores and qualitative explanations

## Customization

You can customize the word lists for different emotional triggers in the `PhishingSentimentAnalyzer` class:

- `urgency_words`: Words that create time pressure
- `fear_words`: Words that induce worry or fear
- `reward_words`: Words that promise benefits or prizes
- `trust_words`: Words that attempt to build false trust

## Future Improvements

This implementation provides a foundation that could be extended in several ways:

1. Adding more sophisticated NLP techniques for emotion detection
2. Training custom sentiment models on phishing-specific datasets
3. Incorporating the sentiment scores into your main model's prediction
